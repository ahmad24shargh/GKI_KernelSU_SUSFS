config CORE_REGDB
	bool "kernel support for regulatory database"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if the kernel is supposed to have regulatory.db
	  available for core hint.

	  Once this is disabled, kernel will not probe for regulatory.db
	  on startup, and any programs using NL80211_CMD_RELOAD_REGDB
	  will be unable to get regulatory.db reloaded.
